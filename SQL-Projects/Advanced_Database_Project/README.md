# Advanced Database Project (40%)

## Overview

This SQL project was completed as part of a 40% coursework submission for the "Advanced Databases" module at the National College of Ireland. The focus of the project was on designing and implementing a database system tailored for the Education Logistics industry, specifically tracking parcels, their contents, destinations, and delivery statuses.

## Project Structure

- `advanced_database.sql`: Contains all `CREATE`, `INSERT`, and `SELECT` statements for the project.
- `CA_Template_2023-24.docx`: The original assessment brief outlining the project requirements.
- `project_preview.png`: Screenshot from the working environment.
- `README.md`: Explanation of the project and key features.

## Key Features

- Multiple interrelated tables: `parcels`, `destination`, `content`, `status_updates`, `main`.
- Business logic incorporated via meaningful queries (e.g., average delays, most frequent delivery issues).
- Advanced analysis: common delays, top destinations, parcel demand by department.

## Business Requirement

This database helps educational institutions manage their delivery systems by analyzing status updates, parcel delay trends, and content logistics. Key stakeholders can identify bottlenecks and optimize delivery and resource planning based on this analysis.

## Technologies

- MySQL
- Structured Query Language (SQL)
