# Advanced Database Project (40%)

## Overview

I completed this SQL project as part of a 40% assignment for the Advanced Databases module at the National College of Ireland. The goal was to design and build a database system for the Education Logistics industry, focusing on tracking parcels, what’s inside them, where they’re going, and their delivery status.
## Project Structure

- `advanced_database.sql`: Contains all `CREATE`, `INSERT`, and `SELECT` statements for the project.
- `CA_Template_2023-24.docx`: The original assessment brief outlining the project requirements.
- `project_preview.png`: Screenshot from the working environment.
- `README.md`: Explanation of the project and key features.

## Key Features

- Multiple interrelated tables: `parcels`, `destination`, `content`, `status_updates`, `main`.
- Business logic incorporated via meaningful queries (e.g., average delays, most frequent delivery issues).
- Advanced analysis: common delays, top destinations, parcel demand by department.

## Business Requirement

This database was built to help educational institutions stay on top of their internal delivery systems. It looks at things like parcel status updates, delays, and what’s being delivered to give a clear picture of how resources move around. The idea is to make it easier for schools or colleges to spot any issues, like common delays or problem areas, and make smarter decisions when planning deliveries or managing stock. In the long run, it helps make the whole logistics process more efficient and less stressful for everyone involved.

## Technologies

This project was developed using MySQL, and all the database logic and analysis were done through standard SQL queries. Everything from creating the tables to running detailed insights was handled within a structured relational database environment.

- MySQL
- Structured Query Language (SQL)
