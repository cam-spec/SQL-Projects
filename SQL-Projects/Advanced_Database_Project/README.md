# Advanced Database Project (40%)

## Overview

I completed this SQL project as part of a 40% assignment for the Advanced Databases module at the National College of Ireland. The goal was to design and build a database system for the Education Logistics industry, focusing on tracking parcels, what’s inside them, where they’re going, and their delivery status.
## Project Structure

- `advanced_database.sql`: Contains all `CREATE`, `INSERT`, and `SELECT` statements for the project.
- `CA_Template_2023-24.docx`: The original assessment brief outlining the project requirements.
- `project_preview.png`: Screenshot from the working environment.
- `README.md`: Explanation of the project and key features.

## Key Features

- Multiple interrelated tables: `parcels`, `destination`, `content`, `status_updates`, `main`.
- Business logic incorporated via meaningful queries (e.g., average delays, most frequent delivery issues).
- Advanced analysis: common delays, top destinations, parcel demand by department.

## Business Requirement

This database helps educational institutions manage their delivery systems by analyzing status updates, parcel delay trends, and content logistics. Key stakeholders can identify bottlenecks and optimize delivery and resource planning based on this analysis.

## Technologies

- MySQL
- Structured Query Language (SQL)
