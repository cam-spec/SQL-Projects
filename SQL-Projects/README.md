# SQL Projects

This repository contains all of my SQL-based academic and personal projects. These include coursework completed as part of my Data Science degree at the National College of Ireland and personal practice projects designed to enhance my database design and SQL querying skills.

Each subfolder represents a specific SQL project with its own README, scripts, and any related files.
